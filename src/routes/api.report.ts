// The auto-reporter's entry point: the LadderReporter mod (in the
// sanctuary-hud repo) POSTs a result here when a ranked-shaped game ends,
// authenticated by a Steam web-API ticket minted from the game's own session
// — Steam itself confirms which account sent it, so a report is exactly as
// trustworthy as that player being signed in.
//
// Trust rules on top of the ticket:
// - the reporter conceding their own LOSS applies immediately (claiming your
//   own defeat is credible);
// - the reporter claiming their own WIN opens the usual 15-minute
//   auto-confirm window, exactly like a manual report — unless the opponent's
//   client corroborates, which applies it on the spot;
// - contradicting reports freeze the match as disputed;
// - a report for a match already settled changes nothing and is answered
//   with that match's id (answerLate), so the mod can still upload to it.
//
// A report for a game that isn't an open ladder match between the two named
// players is answered 404 and ignored — playing unranked is invisible here.

// Direct Postgres access for the server functions — the browser never talks
// to the database (every ladder table has RLS enabled with zero policies, so
// even Supabase's publishable key reads nothing; the server connects as the
// postgres role via DATABASE_URL and bypasses RLS entirely).
//
// DATABASE_URL should be Supabase's shared transaction-mode pooler (port
// 6543): it's IPv4-friendly and built for many short serverless connections.
// Transaction mode can't hold prepared statements, hence prepare: false.
//
// Serverless wrinkle: a warm instance keeps this client (and its sockets)
// between invocations, frozen in between. A connection the pooler dropped
// while we were frozen looks open from here and a query on it never
// answers — and with a shared pool, one dead socket stalls everything that
// queues behind it, which the site sees as "every click hangs for a minute,
// then it all works again". So every query runs under a watchdog: past the
// limit it fails fast and the whole client is thrown away, so the next call
// starts on fresh sockets.

# Matchmaking API (for the in-game mod)

The server half of "queue on the site, get launched into the game". The mod
authenticates once with a Steam web-API ticket and then polls with a bearer
token. Nobody needs the mod to queue: it only decides whether a 1v1 pair gets
the `auto` flow (both games launch themselves) or today's `manual` flow.

All bodies and responses are JSON. Errors are `{ "error": "…" }` with a 4xx
status; a `401` means the token is gone and the mod should mint a new one.

## `POST /api/mm/session`

```json
{ "ticket": "<hex>", "identity": "sanctuarydb-ladder" }
```

→ `{ token, steamId, name, expiresAt }`. The ticket must have been minted with
identity `sanctuarydb-ladder` (the reporter's `TicketIdentity`); `identity` in
the body is optional and only checked for equality. Tokens live 6 hours and
only their hash is stored. Signing in on the site first is not required: the
player row is created here if needed.

Every endpoint below takes `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.

## `POST /api/mm/heartbeat` — every 5 s while the game runs

```json
{ "state": "menu | lobby | loading | ingame", "gameVersion": "…", "modVersion": "…" }
```

→ `{ queued, match }`. `queued` says whether the player is in any site queue;
`match` is `null` or the match object below.

A player is **launchable** while their last heartbeat is under 15 s old and
its state is `menu`. The site shows this next to the queue ("Auto-launch
ready") but never gates queueing on it.

## The match object

```json
{
  "id": "5a4c…-uuid",
  "mode": "auto | manual",
  "status": "countdown | launch | cancelled | failed | done | manual",
  "host": "7656119…",
  "joiner": "7656119…",
  "opponent": { "steamId": "7656119…", "name": "Skoub" },
  "map": "Maps/The_Forge/The_Forge.sanmap",
  "mapName": "The Forge",
  "factions": { "7656119…": "EDA", "7656119…": "Chosen" },
  "slots": { "7656119…": 1, "7656119…": 2 },
  "sessionId": null,
  "countdownEndsAt": "2026-09-03T15:02:10.000Z",
  "cancelledBy": null,
  "reason": null
}
```

- `status: manual` is this site's addition: an open match the mod must not
  launch — it only reports the result when the game ends. `map` is `null`,
  `factions` and `slots` are empty on manual matches.
- `auto` matches start in `countdown` (10 s, site-owned, cancellable on the
  site). At zero, if both players are still startable the status becomes
  `launch`; otherwise the match **falls back to `mode: manual`** with `reason`
  saying who dropped ("Skoub closed the game, so host manually").
- **Startable** is stricter than launchable: the mod has to have heartbeated
  _since the match was made_, not merely in the last 15 s. Ten seconds of
  countdown is one to two heartbeats, so a running game has always checked in
  — and a game closed the moment the match formed, whose last heartbeat is
  still under 15 s old at zero, is caught rather than launched into nothing.
- The heartbeat keeps returning an ended auto match (`cancelled`/`failed`) for
  ten minutes after it was created, so a mod mid-launch learns to stop.
- Match ids are the ladder's UUIDs.

## `POST /api/mm/match/{id}/session` — host only

```json
{ "sessionId": "90150…" }
```

The host's Steam game-server id, as digits (a JSON number is accepted too).
Only while the match is in `launch` (`409` otherwise). The joiner sees it in
`sessionId` on its next heartbeat and joins. Returns the match object.

## `POST /api/mm/match/{id}/event`

```json
{ "type": "lobby_created | joined | ready | started | failed | left", "detail": "optional" }
```

Returns the match object. Two events change the match:

- `failed` with `detail` containing `map missing` → the match falls back to
  `manual` (same situation as a player who stopped being launchable). Any
  other `failed` → `status: failed` with the detail in `reason`.
- `left` before both sides have `started` → `status: failed`.

Timeouts after `launch`, enforced lazily by every poll (site or mod):

| Waiting for      | Limit                  | On expiry (`status: failed`)            |
| ---------------- | ---------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| host `sessionId` | 20 s                   | "Remmy's game could not create a lobby" |
| joiner `joined`  | 30 s after `sessionId` | "Skoub didn't join the lobby"           |
| both `started`   | 60 s after `launch`    | "The game didn't start"                 |

Unless a mod has gone quiet (no heartbeat for 15 s), in which case the match
**falls back to `mode: manual`** instead of failing — someone closed their
game rather than the launch breaking, and the pair still have a match they
can host by hand.

A failed or cancelled auto match is a cancelled ladder match: no rating
change, and both players are free to queue again.

## `POST /api/report`

Unchanged, plus an optional `matchId`. When it names an open match between
the two reported players, that match takes the result; otherwise it is
ignored and the newest open match between them is used as before.

## Why a match went manual

Every 1v1 match that could have been auto but wasn't carries the reason in
`reason` (and on the match page), recorded at pairing time, as long as at
least one player's mod had heartbeated in the last minute:

- `Skoub isn't running the mod`
- `Skoub's last heartbeat was 22 s old` (the mod was there but the poll stalled or stopped)
- `Skoub is in a lobby` / `is loading a game` / `is in a game`
- `no map in the 1v1 pool has a path set`

Two players' reasons are joined with `; `. A countdown that falls back to
manual uses the same wording plus `, so host manually`.

Map paths for every shipped map are seeded server-side (`shipped_maps`), so a
pool map only needs a path typed in on the admin page if the game's list
doesn't already know it.

## A note on `status: manual`

The agreed list was `countdown | launch | cancelled | failed | done`. Open
manual matches report `manual` so the mod has one field to check before doing
anything on the auto path; `done`, `cancelled` and `failed` are reported the
same way for both modes.
